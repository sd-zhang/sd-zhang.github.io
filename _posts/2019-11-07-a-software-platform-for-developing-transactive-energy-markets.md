### Abstract
> Recent trends and technological breakthroughs are changing the way electric power systems are structured and operated. A central role in this new system will belong to the prosumer (producer and consumer in one entity) who will actively participate in the system and make choices of how electricity is generated, used and exchanged. At the same time, this transactional energy system promises beneÔ¨Åt utilities by providing new tools that will help increase system efficiency. This paper introduces the Transactive Renewable Energy Exchange (TREX), a software tool for co-design of market and artificial intelligence-based participants. TREX proved to be a valuable simulation environment that allowed the economy of MicroTE be analyzed empirically using an Agent-based computational economics (ACE) approach. Results showed that grid stability improved, and financial improvements were achieved. Further improvements are expected as the AI portion of this research advances.

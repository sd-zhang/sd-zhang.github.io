### Abstract
*Sustainability considerations are driving energy generation from fossil fuels to renewable sources. Grid infrastructure will be destabilized if these new resources are not coordinated properly. Transactive Energy (TE) is a coordination framework that uses economic and control mechanisms to dynamically balance supply and demand across the entire electrical infrastructure. Transactive Renewable Energy eXchange (T-REX) is presented as a way to engineer TE solutions. Agent-based computational economics is used to simulate real economic processes, which can be used to train reinforcement learning agents that will eliminate human involvement and achieve dynamic balancing in real-time. As a proof of concept, a virtual community test bench was set up using real smart home profiles collected in the Seattle region. Three sets of simulations are performed, with energy storage and trading capabilities progressively added. Economic analysis shows that the prices of energy exchanged within the community reflects the balance of supply and demand. Agents successfully used this price signal to utilize energy storage. This increased income for all participants and improved voltage stability, demonstrating that economic processes alone can be sufficient for TE. Without relying on prohibitively expensive power flow information, systems similar to the proposed test bench can be deployed inexpensively at scale.*
